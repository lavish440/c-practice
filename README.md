## Structure

The repository is organized into directories, each corresponding to a set of exercises:

```
.
├── exercise_1
│  ├── question_1.c
│  ├── question_2.c
│  ├── question_3.c
│  └── ...
├── exercise_2
│  ├── question_1.c
│  ├── question_2.c
│  ├── question_3.c
│  └── ...
├── ...
└── exercise_8
   ├── question_1.c
   ├── question_2.c
   ├── question_3.c
   └── ...

```

Each directory contains `.c` files that represent solutions to specific exercises from the book.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/lavish440/c-practice
   cd c-practice
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Desired Exercise Directory**:

   ```sh
   cd exercise_1
   ```

3. **Compile the C Programs**:
   You can compile any of the C files using a C compiler like `gcc`:

   ```sh
   gcc question_1.c -o question_1
   ```

4. **Run the Executable**:
   ```sh
   ./question_1
   ```
